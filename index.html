        Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor and producer.
         His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth,
          followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of
           commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine 
           among the 100 most influential people in
         the world,[2][3] and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's 
         highest-paid actor.[2][3]

    At the age of 5, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film 
    Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird 
    Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character 
    in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor 
    and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment 
    Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a
     Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000
      and 2001. He stayed 
    in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.

     the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); 
     for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting

      and leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played the title character
       in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his
     second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).
